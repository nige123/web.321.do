## Project Overview

321.do — 3... 2... 1... deploy! A standalone deploy, log analysis, and operations service for managing Perl/Mojolicious services. Replaces in-app deploy endpoints that caused outages by restarting themselves mid-request.

Runs on both the dev machine (`dev.321.do`) and production (`321.do`). The same daemon can deploy locally or remotely; production deploys do a `git fetch` + `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` first.

## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Perl 5.42 (`Mojo::Base -base, -signatures`)
- **Framework:** Mojolicious::Lite
- **Service controller:** UBIC (wrapping Hypnotoad for hot-restart zero-downtime deploys, or Morbo for dev)
- **Web server:** nginx (config managed by 321; SSL via letsencrypt/certbot on live, mkcert on dev — see Dev parity)
- **Config:** A `321.yml` manifest at the root of every service repo. 321 scans sibling directories under `/home/s3` for these. Legacy flat `services.yml` is still read as a fallback.
- **Secrets:** **not 321's job** — each service repo handles its own secrets via its own config files / env loading. 321 only passes through whatever non-sensitive env vars are declared per-target in `321.yml` (`env:`).
- **No database** — stateless, config-driven.

## Architecture

Single lightweight daemon on port **9321**. Entry point is `bin/321.pl` (Mojolicious::Lite). A thin `bin/321` wrapper `exec`s it so the same app serves HTTP routes and CLI commands.

Core modules (`lib/Deploy/`):

- `Config.pm` — loads per-repo `321.yml` manifests, resolves the active target (`dev`/`live`) into a flat service descriptor (including `pid_file`, defaulting beside the entry script).
- `Service.pm` — `status`, `deploy` (git + cpanm + zero-downtime hypnotoad hot swap via USR2, or stop/start bounce + health-gated rollback to the previous sha), `deploy_dev` (no git pull, no rollback), log writes under `/tmp/321.do/deploys/`.
- `Ubic.pm` — generates `ubic/service/<group>/<name>` files from config and installs symlinks under `~/ubic/service/<group>/<name>`. Hypnotoad services get a self-supervising `Ubic::Service::Common` file (start = `setsid … hypnotoad -f` with the manifest logs attached; stop/status via hypnotoad's own pidfile) so a USR2 hot swap never looks like a death to ubic. Morbo and worker services keep `Ubic::Service::SimpleDaemon` with the `perlbrew exec --with … env KEY=VAL …` command line.
- `Nginx.pm` — renders `/etc/nginx/sites-available/<host>` (HTTP + optional SSL), enables the site, runs `nginx -t` + `systemctl reload nginx`. Delegates cert paths and acquisition commands to `CertProvider`.
- `CertProvider.pm` — chooses certbot (live) or mkcert (dev) based on active target; returns cert/key paths and the acquire command. See `## Dev parity`.
- `Hosts.pm` — rewrites the `# BEGIN 321.do managed` block in `/etc/hosts` with dev-target hostnames pulled from `Config->dev_hostnames`. See `## Dev parity`.
- `Logs.pm` — tail / search / analyse for stdout, stderr, and ubic logs.
- `Command.pm` + `Command/` — Mojolicious CLI subcommands registered via `app->commands->namespaces`.

### Targets (dev vs live)

Each service YAML has `targets: { dev: {…}, live: {…} }` with per-target `host`, `port`, `runner`, `env`, `logs`. The active target comes from the `target` cookie (defaults to `dev` in development mode, `live` in production). `POST /target` and `GET /target` set/read it; `Config->service($name)` resolves to the active target.

### Service naming

Service names are `<group>.<name>` (e.g. `321.web`, `123.api`). The group/name split drives the ubic symlink layout: `~/ubic/service/<group>/<name>` → `<repo>/ubic/service/<group>/<name>`.

### Workers and the lifecycle cascade

Services declared under a parent's `workers:` block in `321.yml` are expanded into independent ubic services named `<group>.<workerName>` (a minion worker on `123.api` becomes the ubic service `123.minion`). They share the parent's repo, perl version, and target config, but they have their own pid, logs, and ubic file.

`321 go`, `321 start`, `321 stop`, and `321 restart` treat the parent and its workers as one unit when the *parent* is named. The parent runs first on start/go/restart; workers are restarted after in sorted name order. Stop iterates in reverse — workers first, parent last — so jobs settle before the connection they depend on goes away. Naming a worker directly (`321 restart 123.minion`) acts only on that worker, so a stuck worker can be cycled without disturbing the web tier.

Per-worker failures are reported but don't abort the cascade or the main step. A failed main step skips the worker pass — there is nothing useful to cascade to.

All JSON responses follow `{ status, message, data }`.

### CLI

`bin/321` (or `perl bin/321.pl <subcommand>`):

```
321 list                   # all services with mode, runner, port
321 status [service]       # ubic status for one or all
321 start|stop|restart <service>
321 go <service>           # deploy: git pull + cpanm + ubic restart (dev mode: ubic restart only)
321 install <service>      # first-time: clone + cpanm + ubic + nginx + certbot
321 generate               # regenerate all ubic service files + symlinks
321 do [service] <target> <subcommand> [args]   # run an app's own Mojo subcommand at a target
```

Service-name arguments accept prefix/substring matches (see `Deploy::Command::resolve_service`).

### Running a service's own subcommands (`321 do`)

`321 do` runs one of a service app's **own** Mojolicious subcommands (e.g. a `create_admin` command the app registers) in that service's real runtime — the right perlbrew perl, the target's `env:` (`MOJO_MODE`, `MOJO_CONFIG`, …), and repo-local `PERL5LIB` — from inside the repo, locally on dev or over SSH on live.

```
321 do live create_admin nige@123.do    # cwd repo's service, on live
321 do petals.web live create_admin x   # explicit service
321 do routes                            # cwd repo, dev (default target)
```

The target is whichever argument names a known target (`dev`/`live`); tokens before it are the optional service (else inferred from the cwd `321.yml`); tokens after it are the subcommand and its args. It's **interactive** — a TTY is allocated (`ssh -t` on live, `bash -lc` locally), so prompts work and output streams live, and `321 do` exits with the subcommand's own exit code. Implemented in `Deploy::Command::do`; execution goes through `Deploy::{Local,SSH}::exec_in_dir`.

### Auth

HTTP Basic Auth required in production — credentials `321:kaizen`. Accepted via `Authorization: Basic …` header or `https://321:kaizen@…` URL userinfo. Auth is skipped in development mode and `/health` is always public.

## Dev parity

Dev mirrors production byte-for-byte — same nginx templates, same `listen 443 ssl`, same proxy headers. Two mechanisms keep it that way:

1. **`/etc/hosts` managed block** — `321 generate` (and `321 install`) rewrite the block between `# BEGIN 321.do managed` / `# END 321.do managed` with every dev-target hostname across `services/*.yml`. Non-managed lines are never touched. Needs sudo for the write; print the desired block with `321 hosts --print` first if you want to inspect.

2. **mkcert instead of certbot** — on dev targets, `Deploy::CertProvider` emits `mkcert -cert-file … -key-file …` commands; on live targets, certbot as before. Install once per dev machine:

   ```
   sudo apt install libnss3-tools mkcert   # or: brew install mkcert
   mkcert -install                         # installs the local CA into the system + Firefox/Chrome trust stores
   ```

   Cert files land in `~/.local/share/mkcert/<host>.pem`. The nginx template reads those paths the same way it reads letsencrypt paths in prod — no conditional blocks.

Prod never needs mkcert; dev never needs certbot. Both still use the same `Deploy::Nginx` templates.

## Service Repo Contract

Every service repo installed by 321 must ship a `321.yml` at the repo root. It declares everything 321 needs to clone, build, run, and serve the app — identity, runner, target-specific host/port, and any apt deps.

```yaml
name: love.web              # <group>.<name>
entry: bin/love.pl
runner: hypnotoad           # hypnotoad | morbo | script
perl: perl-5.42.1           # optional; perlbrew version
health: /health             # optional; post-deploy probe path
branch: main                # optional; defaults to master
repo: git@github.com:you/love.honeywillow.com.git
apt_deps:                   # optional; sudo apt-get install before cpanm
  - libfreetype-dev

dev:
    host: love.honeywillow.com.dev
    port: 8888
    runner: morbo
live:
    host: love.honeywillow.com
    port: 8888
    runner: hypnotoad
    ssh: ubuntu@zorda.co
    ssh_key: ~/.ssh/kaizen-nige.pem
    env:                    # plain (non-secret) overrides only
        MOJO_MODE: production
```

**Secrets are the service repo's responsibility, not 321's.** Each app loads its own secrets however it wants (its own config file, an environment loader at startup, etc.). 321 only passes through whatever non-sensitive env vars the target block declares under `env:`.

If a target's hypnotoad runner needs to listen on a specific port, the app's production config must set `hypnotoad => { listen => ['http://*:PORT'] }` to match the manifest port — 321 can't pass it on the command line. A mismatch shows up as a `port_check` failure with the actual bound port in the hint.

### Hot deploys, the health gate, and pid_file

Deploys of a running hypnotoad service are zero-downtime: 321 sends the
manager USR2 (hypnotoad's native hot swap — new workers boot the new code
while the old ones drain) and waits for the pidfile to name a new live
manager. The swap is driven through hypnotoad's own pidfile, which 321
resolves as `<repo>/<entry dir>/hypnotoad.pid` unless the manifest sets
`pid_file:` — **an app that overrides `pid_file` in its hypnotoad config must
mirror the same path in `321.yml`**, or 321 can't find the manager and falls
back to a cold stop/start bounce (safe, but with the old brief downtime).

Every deploy is gated: a `health:` path declared in the manifest must answer
2xx (undeclared health falls back to "anything answers on the port"). On
live, a failed gate rolls the repo back to the pre-deploy sha, puts the old
release back in service (a second hot swap), and reports `rolled_back`. If
the new code fails to even boot, hypnotoad keeps the old release serving and
321 just resets the repo — nothing goes down. Dev deploys report the failure
but never roll back.

The first deploy after 321 itself is upgraded to this scheme does one final
cold bounce per service (the old SimpleDaemon supervision has to be torn down
under the old ubic file before the self-supervising one takes over); every
deploy after that is hot.

### Entry script `@INC` — never glob the local-lib tree

The entry script's `BEGIN` block should add its own `lib/` and the **base** of the bundled local-lib, and stop there:

```perl
use FindBin;
BEGIN {
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/../lib";
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/lib";
    unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/../local/lib/perl5";
}
```

That base is enough: 321 always exports `PERL5LIB=<repo>/local/lib/perl5`, and perl automatically appends the architecture subdir (`…/local/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux`) of every `PERL5LIB` entry, so compiled (XS) modules load with no extra work.

**Do not** glob every subdirectory of the local-lib onto `@INC`:

```perl
# WRONG — puts namespace dirs like HTTP/ on @INC, where HTTP/Config.pm
# shadows core Config and breaks `use Config` in File::Copy / Mojo::File
# with: Global symbol "%Config" requires explicit package name
for my $arch (glob "$FindBin::Bin/../local/lib/perl5/*") {
    unshift @INC, $arch if -d $arch;
}
```

The supervised daemon hides this bug (hypnotoad loads `Config` early), but a bare `perl bin/app.pl <subcommand>` — e.g. via `321 do` — trips it. If you genuinely need the arch dir on `@INC` for a standalone run, resolve **only** that dir, never the whole tree:

```perl
require Config;
unshift @INC, "$FindBin::Bin/../local/lib/perl5/$Config::Config{archname}";
```

`321 doctor` audits every repo's `bin/*.pl` for the bare-glob form and fails if it finds one. `321 do` also preloads core `Config` (`perl -MConfig …`) as a belt-and-suspenders so subcommands survive a not-yet-fixed app.

## Development

```bash
perl bin/321.pl daemon -l http://127.0.0.1:9321
prove -lr t
```

## Coding Conventions

- Four space indentation
- JSON responses: `{ status, message, data }`
- All endpoints require HTTP Basic Auth in production (except `GET /health`)
